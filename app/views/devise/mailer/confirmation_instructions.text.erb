Welcome to Octopi, <%= @staff.name %>
===============
<% if @staff.assign_a_random_password === true %>
An admin has created an account for you. Your login credentials are as follows:
Email: <%= @staff.email %>
Password: <%= @staff.password %>

Your password cannot be sent to you again! We advise you to change your password
once you have logged in. That can be done at:
<%= confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %>
<% else %>
Your account was created with the email: <%= @staff.email %>
<% end %>

You must first confirm your account by using the following url:

<%= confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %>
